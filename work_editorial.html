          <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p><span class="bumpit">A writing program</span> codenamed "content social", comprised of several phases and designed to help Labbrandiands find a specialty, match with the right platform, and produce content (blog format or otherwise) they could be proud of. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="process">
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>Thanks to a successful content curation effort, we weren’t starting from scratch: in past months, each team had regularly produced five articles per week to be added to an internal content sharing board. I started by organizing these articles into topics that related to the consultancy’s focus: brand innovations. With employees from all departments contributing, not to mention people from many different nationalities, we had a wealth of perspectives. </p>

                <h6>The writing program, visualized</h6>
              </div>
            </div>
          <p>I cross-referenced these topics with current offerings, sorted articles based on how employees had tagged them, and began noting possible specialties on a perceptual map. </p>
          <p>With an ear to the grapevine, I researched potential media sites that sounded like a strong match. This provided the opportunity to see what media publications were active and engaged in the local branding scene – previous efforts had put in place plenty of goodwill, which allowed us to develop editorial calendars with media partners, in some cases as far out as a year.</p>
          <p>Illustrations and partnerships ready, I began hosting 1:1 writing consultation sessions with interested parties. By prioritizing areas of expertise top-down, employees could find a topic that was uniquely theirs. </p>
          <p>Pair writing, creative, and editorial helped establish a consistent thread regardless of familiarity with writing; tangible article types helped writers put pen to paper (“I’m the expert” article, “hot topic” article, “list it” article, etc). Finalized content was then bolstered by SEO guidelines and run through the content management process. </p>
            <div class="samplepics two">
              <img src="pictures\Work\Editorial\Brandsource_Result.png" alt="Result, knowledge hub">
              <div class="samplecaptiontwo">
                <h6>Completed knowledge center</h6>
              </div>
            </div>
          <p>Media buy-in, especially during certain busy times of the year, helped the team lock in features from well-known media publications. Asides from helping with the program’s business goals, this incentivized more employees to start writing. </p>
          <p>Building upon the program's momentum, we set the precedent to produce a quarterly long-form report, eventually producing 8 over the course of 2 years. Each issue was custom designed, included a range of departments’ areas of expertise, and asked questions with depth in the branding space.</p>
          <p>Clients provided positive feedback to the thought leadership they saw – especially with regards to the quarterly reports - and the writing program gained esteem internally.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, the team considered this a client priority when it came time to update the website, making sure it looked good and was searchable. </p>
