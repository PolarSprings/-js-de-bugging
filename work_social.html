          <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p><span class="bumpit">An org chart</span> and corresponding content assets, informed by department resources - including details like content type, language, and sub brand - which allowed us to move social from an afterthough to "the next step" in the content's natural lifecycle.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="process">
          <h4>Process</h4>
            <p>With three languages, six networks, and two brands (the consultancy + a new digital sub brand), there were 36 possible social accounts in play. As some channels required mulitple-times-per-day publishing, when and where we decided to allocate team resources was an important question. </p>

                  <h6>Consistency across social</h6>
                </div>
              </div>
            <p>I broke it down into specific questions: which accounts were we regularly posting to, how often, and in what language? With what content? A social account audit got the initiative up and running.</p>
            <p>Without any changes we had 10 different already created, with some great results. Unfortunately, publishing was more irregular than necessary. So, we had a decision to make: should we broaden our scope to more social accounts, or focus on the accounts were already had? To emphasize that consistency, we decided to trim the accounts we didn't need and double down on the rest.</p>
            <p>The next step was a competitor audit; learning best practices from more established agencies who were a step ahead. As a boutique shop, this helped us ID which standard networks to be on, and reinforced our analysis of which we didn't need to bother with. </p>
            <p>Checkpoint time. With all of this information organized, we could take a holistic look at our social strategy. We assigned a priority network to each language, as well as secondary networks to maximize the impact of the content when it was passed from Editorial. We were fortunate to have a group of interns to adjust the formatting and meet the needs of these networks. </p>

                </div>
              </div>
            <p>Thinking long term and with the structure set, the team produced a structured content calendar that considered contributors, frequency, holiday, format - the whole social picture, organized by topic. We created assets based on account as well in the name of efficiency; the global content calendar was available as an alignment tool. </p>
            <p>With the pressure on social to generate results, I dove into the weeds and produced KPIs that corresponded to each of the major networks: LinkedIn, WeChat, Twitter, and Facebook; audiences on each had a preferred format, which we used to inform content creation.</p>
            <p>Making sure each account had clear delegation with a fluent speaker in charge, as well as a document approval process, helped us create a social strategy with staying power.</p>
